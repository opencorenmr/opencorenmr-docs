- This is relevant to Opencore NMR version 2.1.0 and higher.
- In the preamble of a pulse program file (`*.ppg`), we recommend to begin with:
```
version=2.1
```
- If you use the previous version (lower than 2.1.0) and the software detect this statement on compilation, it stops compiling with a error message.
